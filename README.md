# Problem Persisting:

Manufacturing and Pharmaceutical companies such as Prestige, Sun Pharma require a variety of raw materials for their products.

These raw materials are sourced from multiple vendors (a single type of product/raw material can be sourced from more than one vendor). 

The agreement for the product is contracted in advance and for a specified duration such as a month, quarter, or year, i.e., every agreement has an agreement start date and agreement end date. 

Once the agreement date is close by (less than or equal to 15 days from today), the manufacturer floats a new RFP (Request for Proposal) among his vendors for a new agreement and selects the best agreement. An agreement consists of the agreement start date, agreement end date, the total cost per unit for the product, and whether the delivery of the product is the vendor’s responsibility of the manufacturer has to pick up the product from the vendor’s site.


The current process of agreement renewal and settlement takes a long time to reach the completion stage.
